# Contact-Tracing
This project utilizes machine learning and location data for contact tracing, identifying potential disease transmission clusters and aiding public health efforts.

This project involves using machine learning techniques for contact tracing, a crucial strategy in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The goal is to identify and visualize potential interactions between individuals based on their geographical locations over time. The main steps of the project include:

Data Collection: The project starts by collecting location data of individuals at different time intervals. This data could be obtained through sources like GPS-enabled devices, mobile apps, or other location-tracking methods.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to ensure its quality and format. This involves converting latitude and longitude information from strings to numerical values, and cleaning any outliers or irrelevant data.

Data Visualization: The data is then visualized using scatter plots on a geographical map. Each individual's location at various timestamps is plotted, with different colors representing different individuals. This step helps in understanding the movement patterns of individuals.

DBSCAN Clustering: The DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm is used to group individuals who were in close proximity to each other at certain timestamps. This helps in identifying potential clusters of people who might have come into contact.

Infected Individual Detection: Given an input individual's ID, the algorithm identifies clusters they were part of and extracts IDs of other individuals within those clusters. These individuals are considered potentially infected due to their proximity to the input individual.

Visualization of Clusters: The clusters identified by DBSCAN are visualized on the map using different colors. This step provides insights into which areas and individuals might have a higher risk of infection based on their clustering patterns.

Output: The project outputs a list of potentially infected individuals when given the ID of an infected person. Additionally, it provides visualizations of clusters and movements on a geographical map, aiding in contact tracing efforts.

Parameter Tuning: Fine-tuning parameters like epsilon and min_samples for DBSCAN is crucial to achieve meaningful results. Adjusting these parameters can affect the size and quality of the clusters detected.

By combining location data, machine learning, and data visualization, this project contributes to the effort of contact tracing in the context of controlling the spread of infectious diseases. It enables health authorities and policymakers to make informed decisions about interventions and preventive measures based on identified clusters and potential exposure risks.
